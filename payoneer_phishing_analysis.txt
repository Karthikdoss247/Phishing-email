Task: Task 2 – Analyze a Phishing Email Prepared by: Dinesh Date:
2025-12-09

1.  Introduction This report analyzes a suspicious email that
    impersonates Payoneer. The objective is to detect phishing
    indicators such as spoofed sender identity, mismatched URLs, urgent
    language, suspicious attachments, grammar inconsistencies, and
    header authentication failures (if available).

2.  Sample Email Used

Subject: Urgent: Action Required – Verify Your Payoneer Account From:
Payoneer Security Team (actual address not provided in template)

Dear Payoneer Customer,

We’ve noticed unusual activity on your account and require immediate
verification to secure your funds.

Please confirm your account details by clicking the link below:
http://maliciouslink.example.com

Failure to verify within 24 hours will result in limited access to your
funds.

Thank you for your cooperation, Payoneer Security Team

Attachment: None Source: Public phishing template (CanIPhish)

3.  Analysis

3.1 Sender Email Spoofing - Template lacks a real From: address, but the
display name “Payoneer Security Team” can be easily spoofed. - Attackers
commonly use look-alike domains such as: pay0neer.com,
payoneer-secure.com, verification.payoneer-login.com Indicator: Likely
spoofing attempt.

3.2 Header Analysis Template email → no real headers to evaluate. If
real, checks would include SPF, DKIM, DMARC, and Received chain
analysis. Expected phishing outcome: SPF fail, DKIM none, DMARC fail,
non-Payoneer sending IP.

3.3 Suspicious Links Actual URL: http://maliciouslink.example.com - Not
owned by Payoneer - Uses HTTP instead of HTTPS Indicator: Malicious
credential-harvesting link.

3.4 Suspicious Attachments - None included. Indicator: No attachment
risk, but link is malicious.

3.5 Urgency / Threatening Language Examples: - “Urgent: Action
Required” - “Immediate verification” - “Failure to verify within 24
hours” Indicator: Classic phishing urgency.

3.6 Mismatched URLs (Hover Test) Visible text: “Verify Now” Actual URL:
http://maliciouslink.example.com Indicator: Fake URL masked behind
anchor text.

3.7 Grammar / Spelling Issues - Clean grammar, but generic message.
Indicator: Weak signal but supports phishing conclusion.

4.  Summary of Phishing Indicators

5.  Display-name spoofing likely

6.  Missing/verifiable sender domain

7.  Malicious URL unrelated to Payoneer

8.  Strong urgency and threat language

9.  Generic greeting

10. Mismatched URL

11. Insecure HTTP link

12. Expected SPF/DKIM/DMARC failure (if headers existed)

13. Conclusion This email is a phishing attempt aimed at stealing
    Payoneer credentials. Do not click links or respond.

14. Recommended Actions

-   Verify sender domain before acting
-   Hover links before clicking
-   Report suspicious messages
-   Avoid unknown attachments or insecure links
